# DC_Machine_Control_Algorithm
This Repository contains the MATLAB files related to the control algorithm used to control a DC Machine.


"MCC_11_1_init.m" represents the MATLAB file for the control algorithm with the machine being represented by its equations on Simulink (which is more realistic); "MCC_BO.slx", "trial28732792392.slx" are the corresponding Simulink files.

"simpower.m" represents the MATLAB file for the control algorithm with the machine being represented by a similar model in the Simpower library and "tc_simpower.slx" is its corresponding Simulink file.
